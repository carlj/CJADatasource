# CJADataSource

Everyone is writing his own TableView DataSource that is block based, so here is mine.

# Usage

Just add
``` ruby
pod 'CJADataSource'
```
  
to your ```Podfile``` and import all the needed files with ```#import <CJADataSource/CJADataSource>```  
or import the files included in the [CJADataSource](CJADataSource) folder directly into your project.
